You define data models in JavaScript, manipulate them on the client, and Primitive handles everything else—syncing data across devices, authenticating users, and enabling real-time collaboration. No APIs to build. No servers to manage. No complex client-server architecture to maintain.</p><h3 id="why-we-built-primitive" tabindex="-1">Why We Built Primitive <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-we-built-primitive" aria-label="Permalink to “Why We Built Primitive”">​</a></h3><p><strong>Going from idea to production should be simple.</strong> We wanted to make it really easy to go from an idea to a scalable app in production with minimal server setup and a straightforward programming model. Define objects in JavaScript, manipulate them on the client, and don&#39;t worry about what&#39;s client-side, what&#39;s server-side, or managing a complex tech stack.</p><p><strong>Local-first is fast and responsive.</strong> When your app works with a local database, interactions feel instant. No waiting for network round-trips. No spinners. Changes sync in the background while users keep working.</p><p><strong>Real-time collaboration and sharing are hard.</strong> Lots of apps would benefit from users working together on shared data, but building this well is notoriously difficult—conflict resolution, presence awareness, permissions. Primitive handles these challenges so you don&#39;t have to.</p><p><strong>AI coding tools work better with a solid foundation.</strong> Modern AI assistants excel at UI and business logic, but struggle with distributed systems and infrastructure. Primitive gives you a scalable, battle-tested foundation, letting AI tools focus on what they&#39;re good at.</p><p><strong>We&#39;ve built this before—many times.</strong> After building numerous apps, we noticed we were solving the same problems over and over: authentication, analytics, secure blob storage, sharing, billing. Our goal is to provide default answers for all of these product-level concerns out of the box, so more of your time goes into what makes your app unique.</p><h3 id="what-primitive-handles" tabindex="-1">What Primitive Handles <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-primitive-handles" aria-label="Permalink to “What Primitive Handles”">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Data sync</strong> — Changes automatically sync between devices and users</li><li><strong>Authentication</strong> — Google OAuth built in</li><li><strong>Real-time collaboration</strong> — Multiple users can edit shared data simultaneously</li><li><strong>Local persistence</strong> — Data is stored locally for instant access with automatic background sync</li><li><strong>Additional services</strong> — Blob storage, AI, third-party API proxy, analytics, and more coming</li></ul><p>You focus on building your product. Primitive handles the infrastructure.</p><h2 id="prerequisites" tabindex="-1">Prerequisites <a class="header-anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-label="Permalink to “Prerequisites”">​</a></h2><p>Before diving in, you should be comfortable with:</p><ul><li><strong>JavaScript/TypeScript</strong> — All code runs in the browser</li><li><strong>Modern web development</strong> — npm/pnpm, Vite, etc.</li></ul><p>No backend experience required—that&#39;s the point!</p><h2 id="about-the-template" tabindex="-1">About the Template <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-the-template" aria-label="Permalink to “About the Template”">​</a></h2><p>Our template app uses <strong>Vue 3</strong> with the Composition API. We chose Vue because it produces cleaner, more maintainable code—particularly when working with AI coding assistants. Vue&#39;s straightforward reactivity model avoids the complexity of patterns like React&#39;s <code>useEffect</code>.</p><p>That said, <strong>js-bao and the Primitive client are plain JavaScript libraries</strong> that work with any framework. If you prefer React, Svelte, or vanilla JS, you can use the core libraries directly—you&#39;ll just need to set up the integration yourself rather than using our Vue-based <code>primitive-app</code> helpers.</p>',24)])])}const m=t(o,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
