# Example Apps

Explore these example applications to see Primitive in action and learn how different features work together.

## Primitive Platform Demo

**[primitive-app-demo.primitive.app](https://primitive-app-demo.primitive.app/)**

An interactive walkthrough of Primitive's core features. This demo app showcases:

- **Real-time collaboration** — See changes sync instantly across devices
- **Document sharing** — Share documents with different permission levels
- **Authentication** — Google OAuth and passkey-based login
- **Offline support** — Continue working without an internet connection
- **Data models** — Examples of defining and querying data

Use this app to explore the concepts covered in these docs before building your own.

## Simple Todo

**[simpletodo.primitive.app](https://simpletodo.primitive.app/)**

A practical todo list application demonstrating real-world patterns:

- **Multi-document architecture** — Each todo list is a separate document
- **Independent sharing** — Share individual todo lists with different people
- **Cross-document search** — Search across all your todo lists at once
- **Collaborative editing** — Multiple users can edit shared lists simultaneously

This example shows how to structure an app where users create multiple independent documents (todo lists) and selectively share them with others—a common pattern for productivity and collaboration apps.

## Source Code

Both example apps are built on the [primitive-app-template](https://github.com/Primitive-Labs/primitive-app-template). You can use them as reference when building your own applications.
