# Platform Overview

Primitive is a backend platform for app developers. You focus on your UI and business logic; Primitive provides the backend services — authentication, data storage, real-time sync, file storage, server-side workflows, LLM integration, and more. No APIs to build. No servers to manage.

## Core Services

### Authentication
Multiple sign-in methods out of the box — Google OAuth, Magic Link (passwordless email), OTP (email codes), and Passkeys (biometric/WebAuthn). Token management, session handling, and refresh are all handled for you.

### Data Storage

Primitive offers two complementary storage systems:

- **Documents** — Local-first, real-time collaborative data. Your app reads and writes to a local in-browser database; changes sync automatically across devices and users. Great for user-owned data, offline access, and real-time collaboration.

- **Databases** — Server-side structured storage. Define operations (queries, mutations) with fine-grained access control. Great for shared records, cross-user data, admin-controlled content, and server-enforced business rules.

Most apps use one or both — see [Choosing Your Data Model](./choosing-your-data-model.md) for guidance.

### Users and Groups
Every user gets a built-in profile (name, email, avatar) managed by the platform. Groups let you organize users into teams, roles, or any relationship — with flexible, expression-based access control that works across both documents and databases.

### Workflows
Server-side multi-step automation pipelines. Chain together LLM calls, data transformations, external API requests, delays, and conditional logic. Define them as TOML config files in your repo. Trigger them from your app, from inbound webhooks, or on a cron schedule.

### Managed Prompts
Version-controlled LLM prompt templates with built-in testing. Define prompt configurations, test them against expected outputs, and use them in workflows or directly from your app.

### Integrations
Securely proxy requests to external APIs. Primitive stores your API keys server-side and handles authentication, so your client code never sees credentials.

### Blob Storage
Upload, download, and manage files (images, PDFs, attachments). Document-scoped blobs inherit document permissions and include offline caching, upload queues, and prefetching. General-purpose blob buckets add TTL tiers, signed URLs, and CEL-based access rules for storage that lives outside a specific document.

### Sharing and Access
Share documents and databases with other users — by user ID, by email (grants that resolve at signup), or with an entire group. Document access requests let users with a link ask for access Google-Docs-style. Member invitations with quotas let regular members invite teammates without admin involvement.

### Analytics
Automatic lifecycle event tracking (daily active users, session end, network recovery) plus custom event logging. Query metrics via the CLI or REST API.

Your app runs in the browser. The Primitive backend is a managed service that runs on edge infrastructure — you interact with it through the client library and CLI, never directly with the underlying infrastructure.

## The Stack

Primitive provides three libraries that work together:

### js-bao — Data Layer
A JavaScript ORM for defining data models and performing queries. Works with any framework. When used with documents, it reads and writes to a local in-browser database for instant operations.

```typescript
import { defineModelSchema, BaseModel } from "js-bao";

const taskSchema = defineModelSchema({
  name: "tasks",
  fields: {
    id: { type: "id", autoAssign: true, indexed: true },
    title: { type: "string", indexed: true },
    completed: { type: "boolean", default: false },
  },
});

export class Task extends BaseModel {
  static schema = taskSchema;
}
```

### js-bao-wss-client — Backend Client
Manages all interaction with the Primitive backend: authentication, document sync, database operations, blob storage, workflows, LLM calls, integrations, and analytics.

```typescript
import { JsBaoClient } from "js-bao-wss-client";

const client = new JsBaoClient({
  apiUrl: "https://api.primitiveapi.com",
  wsUrl: "wss://api.primitiveapi.com",
  appId: "your-app-id",
  models: [Task],
});
```

### primitive-app — Vue Integration
Vue 3 components, services, and dev tools for building Primitive apps. Includes pre-built UI components (forms, tables, dialogs), a singleton client service, and a Vite plugin for development tools (Document Explorer, Test Harness, Blob Explorer).

::: tip Framework Flexibility
js-bao and js-bao-wss-client are plain JavaScript — they work with React, Svelte, Solid, or vanilla JS. The primitive-app package adds Vue-specific helpers, but the core platform is framework-agnostic.
:::

### Primitive CLI
A command-line tool for managing your app's backend configuration. Configure authentication, manage users, define workflows and prompts, set up integrations, and sync configuration as version-controlled TOML files. Also serves as the interface AI coding agents use to manage your app.

## What Runs Where

| Your App (Browser) | Primitive Backend |

| UI rendering and interaction | Authentication and sessions |
| Document data models and queries | Data sync between clients |
| Business logic and validation | Server-side databases |
| Offline data access | Workflow execution |
| | Blob storage |
| | LLM and API proxying |
| | Analytics collection |
