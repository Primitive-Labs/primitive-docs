## What is Primitive?

Primitive is a platform for building **local-first web applications**. Instead of building APIs and managing servers, you write client-side code that works with a local database. Primitive handles:

- **Data sync** — Changes automatically sync between devices and users
- **Authentication** — Google OAuth built in
- **Real-time collaboration** — Multiple users can edit shared data simultaneously
- **Offline support** — Apps work without an internet connection
- **Additional services** — Blob storage, AI, third-party API proxy, analytics

You focus on building your product. Primitive handles the infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should be comfortable with:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** — All code runs in the browser
- **Vue 3** — The template uses Vue with the Composition API
- **Modern web development** — npm/pnpm, Vite, etc.

No backend experience required—that's the point!
