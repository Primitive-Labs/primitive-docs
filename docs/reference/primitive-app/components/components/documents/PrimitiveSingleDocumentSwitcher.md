# PrimitiveSingleDocumentSwitcher

---

Single-document mode switcher dropdown shown at the top of the sidebar.

Displays the current document name and allows switching between available
documents (once loaded), plus a shortcut to the “Manage Documents” page.

This component is designed to be used only with Primitive App’s **single-document mode**.
If your app is using multi-document mode, you should not use this component.
